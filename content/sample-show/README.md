Brightsign Supershow Media Format
==================================

# WARNING
Basically this is a hole in the ground where we'll pour concrete for a foundation. In fact, none of this works. It's all lies, or design fiction if you prefer.

# The Gist
Two tools, `package.py` and `shovel.py` will take movie files and push them to brightsigns. They'll also take a bunch of movies, and some configuration instructions, and format them appropriately for the brightsigns.
